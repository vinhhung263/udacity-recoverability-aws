AZ outage:
- In a multi-AZ RTO is the time which takes to launch a new RDS instance, so RTO is 1-3 minutes for each single AZ outage. 
- RPO is 0 because there is no data loss, during the failover from primary instance to secondary.

Regional Problem:
- The time to advertise the replica in the event of a single area outage, according to RTO. 
- This will promote the replica for around 5mins. RPO is 10 mins because it is asynchronous cross-region.
